    <h1>About Me</h1>
<div>
    <p>Born in Cleveland, Ohio but later raised in Greenwood, South Carolina. Raised by my mother and I'm the youngest sibling, my sister being the oldest. We lived in the Carolinas for over 10 years. I started my journey at the college of Winthrop University in 2005 where I studied Sports Management. I graduated in 2010! Although I didnt start my Fullstack-Development back then, I've been interested in coding for a while. </p>
